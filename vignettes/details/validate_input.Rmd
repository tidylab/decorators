## How It Works

When a function fails in R, some functions produce a run-time error while others
return `NULL` (and potentially prompt a warning). What the function evokes in
case of a failure is subjected to its programmer discretion. Usually, the
programmer follows either a punitive or forgiving policy regarding how
run-time errors should be handled.
