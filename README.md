A ***decorator*** is a function that receives a function, extends its
behaviour, and returned the altered function. Any caller that uses the
decorated function uses the same interface as it were the original,
undecorated function.

## Examples

### `time_it` decorator

``` r
# Running the original Sys.sleep() produces no output
Sys.sleep(0.1)

# Decorating the Sys.sleep() with time_it() measures Sys.sleep() execution time 
# and outputs the measurement   
Sys.sleep <- decorators::time_it(base::Sys.sleep)
Sys.sleep(0.1)
#> Time difference of 0.11 secs
```

### `validate_arguments` decorator

``` r
## Define a functions that averages two numbers
average_two_numbers <- function(a = NA_real_, b = NA_real_) mean(c(a, b))

## Before: Averaging two nun-numeric values returns NA and prompts a warning
average_two_numbers(a = "1", b = "2")
#> [1] NA
```

``` r
## Decorating average_two_numbers() with validate_arguments() checks input types
average_two_numbers <- decorators::validate_arguments(average_two_numbers)

## After: Averaging two nun-numeric prompts an informative error
average_two_numbers(a = "1", b = "2")
```

    #> Error in average_two_numbers(a = "1", b = "2") : 
    #>   a is of type `character` rather than `numeric`!

## Installation
